; This file always lives in c:/sys.
; If you run .jetdpcl5 with no arguments it will read the printer definitions from this file.
; If you run .jetdpcl5 -p="c:/foo/prn*.cfg" you can override it to read the definitions using an alternate location/wildcard.
; The line below points to your printer definitions, which can live wherever you like on your SD card.
; Each printer has its own file, which should be named so that, when sorted alphabetically, the first one becomes printer ID 1, the second becomes printer ID 2, etc.
; See c:/demos/JetDPCL5/DemoPrinter.cfg for an example printer definition file.
